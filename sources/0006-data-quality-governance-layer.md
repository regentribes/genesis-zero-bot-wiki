# ADR 0006 — Data Quality and Governance for Knowledge Layer

## Context

ADR 0004 (LLM Wiki) and ADR 0005 (RAG + Agent Memory) establish three knowledge patterns for the Integral stack. But the article identifies a critical gap that most teams underinvest in: **the governance layer underneath all three**.

> "The governance layer underneath all of them — data quality, freshness, access control — is what most teams underinvest in. Stale or ungoverned inputs degrade all three simultaneously."

This ADR establishes the governance requirements that apply across all three knowledge patterns.

## Decision

Implement four governance requirements across the knowledge layer:

### 1. Source Provenance (required for all wiki pages)

Every concept page must cite at least one source page. No synthesized claim without a backing source. `wiki lint` enforces this — pages with missing `sourceIds` fail validation.

### 2. Freshness Tracking (required for all concept pages)

Every page carries `updatedAt` and is checked by `wiki lint` for staleness. Pages older than 30 days without update trigger a stale-page warning.

### 3. Contradiction Detection (enforced by `wiki lint`)

When two concept pages make conflicting claims, `wiki lint` surfaces the contradiction. A human must adjudicate. The resolution gets recorded as a new claim with `status: resolved` and evidence pointing to the adjudication source.

### 4. Ingest Quality Gates (required before wiki commit)

Before any source page is committed to the vault:
- Source must be cited in at least one concept page
- Concept page must pass `wiki lint` with 0 errors
- Source must have valid `provenance` frontmatter (source URL or file path)

## Options Considered

| Option | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Trust LLM ingest quality | Rejected — errors compound in LLM Wiki; no quality gate means bad synthesis baked permanently |
| Manual review every ingest | Rejected — unsustainable at scale; creates bottleneck |
| Automated lint + provenance + staleness checks | Adopted — `wiki lint` enforces all four requirements |

## Consequences

### Positive
- All three knowledge patterns share the same governance foundation
- Quality degradation caught before propagation
- Clear audit trail: source → concept → claim → evidence
- Wikilink integrity maintained via `wiki lint`

### Negative
- Ingest workflow is slower (requires lint + provenance before commit)
- Contradiction adjudication requires human time

### Risks
- If `wiki lint` is not run after every ingest, governance requirements slip
- Staleness warnings can pile up if vault is not actively maintained

## Implementation

These requirements are enforced by `openclaw wiki lint` in the standard workflow:

```
openclaw wiki ingest <source>
openclaw wiki compile
openclaw wiki lint  # fails if: missing sourceIds, missing provenance, stale page, contradiction
```

Wiki vault mode `isolated` means all governance is self-contained. No external dependency.
