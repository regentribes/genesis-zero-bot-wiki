# ADR 0005 — RAG and Agent Memory in the Integral Stack

## Context

ADR 0004 established LLM Wiki as the M10 knowledge commons layer. This ADR addresses where the other two patterns — RAG and Agent Memory — fit into the Integral architecture.

The Integral system has three distinct knowledge problems:

1. **User knowledge** — Who is each member? What is their FOT trajectory? ITC ledger state? AME interaction history? (changes at conversation time)
2. **Domain knowledge** — OAD principles, ITC ledger rules, regenerative community patterns, AME architecture (changes at ingest time)
3. **Corpus knowledge** — deliberation records, community proposals, historical decisions, meeting notes (changes frequently, large volume)

Each problem requires a different pattern.

## Decision

Assign RAG and Agent Memory to specific subsystems:

| Pattern | Subsystem | What it manages |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| Agent Memory | AME + ITC ledger | Member profiles, FOT trajectories, interaction history, trust scores |
| RAG | CDS deliberation records | Historical deliberations, proposals, CDS state snapshots |
| LLM Wiki | M10 (knowledge commons) | Compiled domain synthesis, cross-referencing, regenerative patterns |

**Agent Memory is NOT used for domain knowledge.** It knows the user but is blind to domain knowledge unless paired with a document layer. In the Integral stack, this means Agent Memory manages member context (who am I talking to, what's their FOT state) while LLM Wiki manages domain context (what does OAD say about this).

**RAG is NOT used for domain synthesis.** RAG re-derives from raw chunks on every query. For compiled synthesis (OAD principles, ITC rules), use LLM Wiki. RAG is correct for CDS deliberation records because they are high-volume, frequently updated, and require breadth-first retrieval rather than compiled synthesis.

## Options Considered

| Option | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Use Agent Memory for everything | Rejected — memory is sparse/noisy; domain knowledge and user knowledge are orthogonal problems |
| Use RAG for everything | Rejected — stateless by default, re-derives synthesis on every call |
| Use LLM Wiki for everything | Rejected — no personalization layer; wiki reads identically for every user |
| Three-pattern assignment (adopted) | Each pattern addresses one distinct knowledge problem |

## Consequences

### Positive
- Each pattern applied where it actually works
- Agent Memory provides personalization without redundant domain re-synthesis
- RAG handles large dynamic CDS corpus without polluting LLM Wiki with raw deliberation chunks
- Clear separation: memory = who, wiki = what, RAG = evidence

### Negative
- Three systems to maintain
- Cross-system consistency requires governance (dealt with in ADR 0006)

### Risks
- Agent Memory needs careful extraction discipline (memory is noisy — only stores what was explicitly said)
- RAG over CDS deliberation records requires careful chunking to preserve deliberation context
